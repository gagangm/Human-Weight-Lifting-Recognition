# Human-Weight-Lifting-Recognition
In this project goal is to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. The five ways are exactly according to the specification (Class A), throwing the elbows to the front (Class B), lifting the dumbbell only halfway (Class C), lowering the dumbbell only halfway (Class D) and throwing the hips to the front (Class E). Only Class A corresponds to correct performance. The goal of this project is to predict the manner in which they did the exercise, i.e., Class A to E.   For more information refer to the website: &lt;http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har> (see the section on the Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset).
